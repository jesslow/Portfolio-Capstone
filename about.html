                <h1>A little about me :)</h1> <!-- Add sth about Aikido?? -->
                <p>As a SMU Information Systems sophomore double majoring in Smart City Management & Technology and Data Science & Analytics, I am excited to learn more about how to leverage on data analytics to solve smart city problems. I love trying new things & gaining new experiences, and hope to continue pursuing such growth over the course of my lifetime.</p>
                <p>The majority of my spare time is spent reading. I derive immense joy from losing myself to the ebb and flow of words on the page, and the picture they paint through its musicality. Particularly, I seek to gain insights from these authors, be it via the trials they put their characters through, or the opinions of expert writers on world politics.</p>
                <p>I also enjoy a good movie and TV show. (I am a proud Disney fan).</p>
